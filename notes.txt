*it is a template using html and css
*as a ui developer you will receive from the teamleader the design made by the ui-ux designer on photoshop(.psd) and you will convert this design into code
*ui developer: focuses on html css bootstrap javascript jquery
*front-end: focuses on javascript
*starting the template, you should think more than one time:
    (1)observe the repeated things .. divs and in each div there is a header and a line under it
        there is lots of hover which uses opacity .. you will make one style and use grouping
        make the folder of your template then make folders and files of the template
* there is library called (font awesome) will be downloaded .. you should take web fonts and all.min.css
* we will need the font type: varela, round, san-serfis
* it is preferred to put the style.css file as the last file implemented in your html code
* container will be into each section and we will not make one container for all the sections of our website
* second solution of float problem is to put all the nav bar in another div and give it ---> overflow: hidden; .. why we don't give it for container because it is general and it will be used another time
* it is preferred to use a for padding in the navbar for links because when hovering it will make the mouse be a hand
* a is inline but ul is inline-block
* if you found an image and there is text on it, this is image is preferred to be made by css(background-image: url();)
    but if there is no text you can made it by html and position
        difference: image with css ---> you can't save this is image to your computer
            html ---> you can save it
* it is preferred to give all elements (a class): because if you want to make any modification to change h1 to div for example
* don't capitalize any character in html do it in css
* view port: the view of the website i can see now without scrolling
* background-size: cover; to make the photo to cover all the website
* if you put the overlay in a div beside the content what happens and what is the solution?
    we can't select the content and the solution is to put the content inside the overlay div
* we use position for two ways one of them is hero-image: to center an element in an another element
* transition is made on all the element and to make it on a specific property you should do this ----> transform: opacity 0.5;
* position fixed and width 100%: will shrink the element
* position fixed and absolute: will convert the element from block to inline-block
* when you made overflow hidden and you made a subset like blogposts you need to use the traditional way --> clear: both;
* the element takes margin: auto is the block
* you can make it absolute even if the parent is absolute or relative or fixed
* you should make utilities.css file to make clean code ... it really affects the performance of your website
